##Using and examples
To use code, import index.js file to your code and you can use to function transformString and transformArray from that.

```transformString``` takes a string as an argument and returns a mirrored string;

For example: 
Next function call will be return ```'olleH dlroW'```;

```
 transformString('Hello World')
 
```

```tranformArray``` takes two arrays as an arguments and return one.
For example:
Next function call will be return ```[1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c']```;
``` 
  transformArray([1,2,3], ['a', 'b', 'c']);
```
